libuuuid - Unified UUID Library
===============================

libuuuid aims at providing small portable UUID library. It does not
implement standard by itself, but instead utilizes most common
implementation on running platform and exposes consistent API.
Motivations for writing such library were both incompatibilities between
native APIs and problems with ossp-uuid[1] implementation to coexist with
current libraries.

===================

 * Linux - requires libuuid from util-linux-ng

 * FreeBSD - uses implementation from libc

 * Windows - runs on Windows 2000 and higher

 * Solaris - similarly to Linux through libuuid
